[Open Morty’s room]
(Morty is asleep in his bed when Rick stumbles in, obviously really drunk, and turns
on the lights.)
Rick: Morty! You gotta come on. Jus'... You gotta come with me.
Morty: *rubs his eyes* What, Rick? What’s going on?
Rick: I got a surprise for you, Morty.
Morty: It's the middle of the night. What are you talking about?
Rick: *spills booze on Morty's bed* Come on, I got a surprise for you. *drags Morty by the ankle* Come on,
hurry up.
(Rick pulls Morty out of his bed and into the hall.)
Morty: Ow! Ow! You're tugging me too hard!
Rick: We gotta go, gotta get
outta here, come on. Got a surprise for you Morty.
[Trans. Rick's ship]
(Rick drives through the night sky. Morty looks exhausted.)
Rick: What do you think of
this... flying vehicle, Morty? I built it outta stuff I found in the garage.
