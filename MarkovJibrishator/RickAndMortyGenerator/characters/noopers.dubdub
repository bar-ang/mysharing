 morty smith. i’m scroopy noopers. i’m a scientist. can i show you something?
 [pulling out a gun] right now.
 the centre of pluto, mr. smith, is made up of a substance called plutonium. mines like these suck plutonium up to the cities, where corporations use it to power everything, from diamond cars to golden showers. and the more we remove, the more pluto shrinks.
 there it goes again. just shrank a little. but a few years ago, your scientists had noticed pluto had gotten so small they couldn’t even call it a planet any more. should have been our wake up call. but the rich plutonians won’t wake up. and they love your dad telling everyone pluto’s a planet, because that means they can keep mining until pluto goes from planet to asteroid to meteor, and finally, poof. [at the last word, he blows a handful of blue dust into the air]
 is everyone in your family an idiot?
 [sigh] well, all you have to do is get him to admit that, and you could save four billion lives.
 you animals! animals!
 you can’t kill the truth, father!
