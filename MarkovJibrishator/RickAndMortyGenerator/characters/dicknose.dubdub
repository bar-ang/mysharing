 man vs. car. the newest hit show where it pits a man against a car. tonight's episode jenkins fights... a regular old car. here we go. he's pushin' his way through, he's trying to fight that car. the car seems to have the upper hand- oh, he just got some push-back there.
 oh, he just got ran over and chewed up by the tires. i guess that's another one for the car. ha ha ha ha ha... i mean the cars always win.
