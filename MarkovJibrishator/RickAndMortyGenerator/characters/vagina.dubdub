 hello? mrs. smith? this is principal vagina, no relation. i wonder if you and morty's father might be able to have a chat with me this afternoon?
 the fact is, your son, morty, has attended this school for a total of seven hours over the last two months.
 i done been notifying you. have you not been getting the messages i've been leaving with morty's grandfather?
 yeah, see, i thought something was fishy there, because it's usually morty's grandpa that's taking him out of school.
 we had a little incident. a student was frozen to death. (chuckles) and there's no evidence that a latino student did it! everyone wants to take this to a racial place. i won't let them.
 (over the intercom, while the students talk) principal vagina here, don't let the name fool you, i'm very much in charge, reminding you that tonight is our annual flu season dance. i don't know how many times i have to say this but if you have the flu, stay home, the flu season dance is about awareness, not celebration. you don't bring dead babies to passover.
 (stops the fight, pulling brad back, aided with mr. goldenfold) that's enough bradley. we don't want you injuring your ball-throwing arm.
 [taking ball] iâ€™ll take it!
 thank you very very much, great store, great place, bye.
