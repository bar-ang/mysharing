 hey, i'm stealy. follow me on my adventure through this office. alright, here we go. we're gonna just steal a couple of things. (he walks into another room and just starts taking things)
 starting with common office objects.
 such as staplers and pins and all sorts of things like-such as that.
 all right, okay, we're in the quiet safe room where none of the people whose stuff i stole can get to us. now, let's look at all the stuff we got. we got a bag of bobbish. that's eight brapples. we got a plumbus. that's six and a half brapples. we got, uh, a-crushed party cups. fifteen and a half brapples.
