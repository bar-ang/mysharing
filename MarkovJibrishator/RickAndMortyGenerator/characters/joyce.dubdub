 after your father’s brush with cancer and losing your uncle, we looked at life and wondered how have we spent it? and how do we spend the rest of it? what are we going to be when we die? a list of fears and questions, or a collection of real experiences?

 you did it again, cubby. come here.
 well, christmas doesn’t revolve around what you hate, son.
