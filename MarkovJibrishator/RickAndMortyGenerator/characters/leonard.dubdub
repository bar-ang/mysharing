 merry christmas, son.
 *puts an arm around jacob’s shoulders* the way we see it, he’s a part of the family.
 then jacob came into our lives. we’re learning to live again.
 now wait, there, there’s no point to secrecy. let’s all live and die honestly. your mother and i have shared forty years of each other, mind, body, and soul. (jerry and jacob smile at each other, but when jacob looks away, jerry’s smile becomes a glare.) and when minds and souls are joined for eternity, and when eternity is at the door, it’s an invitation to let go of the body, and an opportunity to share and experiment.
 no no no no no no. (jerry sighs in relief.) jacob is your mother’s lover. (jerry again looks disturbed.) i watch them. sometimes from a chair, sometimes from a closet. almost always dressed as superman.
 oh, summer. sing it! haha.
