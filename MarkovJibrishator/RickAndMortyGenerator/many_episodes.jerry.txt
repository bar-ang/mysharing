 i see there's a new episode of that singing show tonight. who do you
 what?
 damn it!
 beth!
 *glaring at rick* okay, with all due respect, rick what am i talking
 what? for real?
 knock, knock.
 my manager gave me an hour for lunch, and i thought, "hey, why not swing by where your wife works?"
 well, it's lunch. i mean, it's one of three meals that have existed for millennia.
 well, yeah, on horses.
 i told you i was ordering you something for valentine's day. more importantly, your father is a horrible influence on our son.
 since we're fighting, if you ever have an affair with that guy, i will come to the hotel room and blow my brains out all over your naked bodies.
 (cough) ahem, horse heart surgeon.
 boom! told you! in your face! he is ruining our child! wait, what am i celebrating?
 well, now you can build baskets and watch paul newman movies on vhs and mentally scar the boy scouts every christmas.
 morty, stay out of this. you are obviously not capable of judging these situations on your own.
 oh, for crying out- he's got some kind of disability or something. is that what you want us to say?
 well, duh doy, son. look, i love you, morty, but we both know you're not as fast as the other kids, and if you want to compete in this world, you got to work twice as hard.
 holy crap. he's right.
 but-
 no, i-i understand. uh, maybe we overreacted. but he has to keep going to school.
 okay. well, uh, morty, it's your bedtime in an hour. don't stay up all night again. this is good, though. this can work. i think we can be a family and now, beth, if you'll have me, i would love to have you.
 what? why are you looking at me? you want to go outside? outside? (sigh)
 outside?
 are you kidding me?! come on!
 your idiot dog!
 don't praise him now, morty! he just peed on the carpet! bad dog! bad!
 hey, wait, hold on a second, rick. you wouldn't by any chance have some sort of crazy science thing you could whip up that might help make this dog a little smarter, would you?
 listen, rick, if you're gonna stay here rent-free and use my son for your stupid science, the least you could do is put a little bit of it to use for the family. you make that dog smart or morty's grounded!
 holy crap!
 now bring me my slippers.
 this is what i'm talking about. this is a dog.
 you said the same thing, equally sarcastically, at our wedding and guess what?
 aw, he's saying "i love lasagna".
 i should call bob saget. is that still a thing?
 whoa! hey, buddy. what you got going on there?
 okay, yeah. i get what beth was talking about. fun's over.
 why not?
 hey. oh, wow. okay, is is is everything okay in here?
 snuffles, we didn't mean you any harm! this is a huge misunderstanding.
 well, i'm not calling him that. that's ridiculous.
 huh! you think you can control me with a haircut?
 i can't believe how mean snuffles got just because he's smart.
 whoa, whoa, whoa. we're not going anywhere. this is my house. i'm not abandoning it.
 wait a minute. i have an idea. gentlemen, a moment of your time. (jerry pees on a pile of guns) see that? i'm peeing all over your special guns. that means i own them.
 i'm sorry. it's just like the end of "old yeller.
 *singing* last king christmas last arrived!
 *singing* in the christmas christmas! *stops singing and smells the ham* mmm… jerry, you are really giving it to this ham.
 um, merry christmas? *puts his hands on his hips* helloooo? my parents are coming over for the first time in years! can we stow the gadgets and look alive?
 good one.
 you ‘hey man’! this holiday is about humanity.
 okay, whatever. all electronic items are going in the stocking. now.
 put it in the stocking, summer, or i’m joining facebook.
 more like whoa whoa whoa. what is this? my parents are coming!
 *squinting suspiciously* yeah, it is… i don’t get it.
 huh. you think you know a guy. (the doorbell rings.) okay, there’s my parents. now remember, no tv, no phones, no laptops, we are connecting this christmas, like old-school jews on a saturday. *opens the door* hey hey!
 oh, hi. can i help you?
 *smiling uncomfortably* i wish… but thank you. *closes the door* so… you’re a…friend of the family…?
 wow!
 …cool… eggnog?
 aha… i’m sorry jacob, i guess i’m still confused about the precise nature and origin of your relationship with my parents. are you like a—are you like their caretaker? is that what it is?
 dad, please, what are you saying?
 speak for yourself! because it, heheh, it sounds like you’re about to say jacob is your lover.
 i get it, beth. be careful what you wish for. i’m being punished for taking your ipad.
 *stands up* summer, do you have a boyfriend?
 um…
 no! stop! i hate this!
 well then, i hate christmas! enjoy being human! you guys are gross and lame.
 ah, rick?
 *enters anyway* i wanted to say i’m sorry i ever judged you. *leans on the ping pong table, looking down at ruben’s corpse* right now, you’re my sanest relative.
 well, i can see that you’re busy… merry christmas, rick.
 *stands and hugs her* it’s alright! the tv says there’s nothing to worry about.
 sure, sweetie. *pulls out the stocking and gives summer her phone, then gives beth her tablet* everybody, take a device. it’ll help you relax.
 yeah. *puts an arm around beth and jacob* i guess we really learned something this christmas, jacob.
 okay, jerry, big pitch meeting. make-or-break time. *trims nostril hairs while driving* you can do this.
 *inhales deeply* gotta relax. it's just a pitch. gotta relax.
 hmm. human music. i like it. *rocks head side to side in rhythm with the music*
 national apple farmers of america…
 welcome to our ad agency. i'm jerry smith. (audience stares blankly.) alright. i'll just get to the pitch. um, simple question, gentlemen, *hoarsely* what are apples? *clears throat* excuse me. *drinks some water* ahh. *coughs, clears throat* what are apples? *pulls poster board to the front of the room* apples are food. and when do we need food? when we're hungry. (audience stares blankly.) with that, i give you your new slogan! (flips paper to reveal sign saying “hungry for apples?” audience continues staring.) well, say something! do you like it?
 you do?
 so i sold it? i sold the idea?
 oh my god! thank you!
 hey! i just sold my first pitch!
 guess who just sold the apples campaign.
 me! i guess it wasn't a rip-off of "got milk?" after all. guess someone was wrong.
 well, all is forgiven, because right now, i’ve got an erection the size of an east coast lighthouse, and i’m coming home to share it with my beautiful wife.
 wait, really?
 yes! see you in 10 minutes! *hangs up, shouts* hey! i'm going to make love to my wife!
 *kisses beth, who is still in front of the phone* mm. mm. mm. yeah, don't move. mm, mm, mm, mm! mm!
 yeah! you like that? now who's unremarkable? you hungry for apples? are you hungry for apples?!
 oh, my god. that's the best sex i've ever had in my life. it's… it's too good. i don't deserve this, beth. i'm a fraud.
 mr. marklevitz, do you have a minute to talk?
 look, i’m a fraud. i mean, let's face it. "hungry for apples" is just a rip-off of "got milk?" it's almost identical.
 okay. i deserve that. um, i guess i'll just pack up my desk.
 *crying* oh my god. wait. you know what?! no! the milk people don't have a patent on simple rhetorical questions! y-you— there's not even a single word in "hungry for apples" that's shared by "got milk?" it's a completely different slogan. it's different! and i shouldn't be fired. i should be promoted!
 yeah! wait. really?
 yes! i mean, it may be derivative, but it's the most successful campaign to come out of this agency in a long time.
 i-i’m not saying it should win an award for commercials, but it could certainly be nominated for an award for commercials specifically about apples, like an appley or something.
 is there really an award called the appley for apple-related ad campaigns?
 could we nominate me?
 holy crap!
 i got to tell you, this morning, i didn't even know this award existed. now i'm holding one. and, um… look, i want to say that today was the best day of my life but the truth is, it's, it's more meaningful than that.
 yes. thank you, sir. i am finally complete!
 aah! what the hell?! (appley award glitches out of existence.) no.
 *sobbing* no!
 what the…?
 you know what, rick? those guys took you for a ride, too. you should try having a little respect for the dummies of the universe, now that you're one of us.
 whoa! what the hell?! w-what happened back there?
 so… what do you think?
 wha--? but t-this idea was tested in a state-of-the-art simulation.
