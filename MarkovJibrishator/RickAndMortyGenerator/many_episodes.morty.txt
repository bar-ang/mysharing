 "inception" made sense.

 ooooooaaahhh!
 man, he sure says "bitch" a lot!
 but that's the opposite of what-
 hey, you know what? you got a really good point there, rick. like, if the truth was that we could hide, it's not like he'd be sharing that information with us, you know? i-i-i think it's a good idea, rick.
 wow, you know what? i mean, it looks like we could have just hid this whole time. boy, rick, that was some good thinking.
 oh, boy, rick. i can only imagine what horrible things must, you know scare scary terry.
 hey, yo, scary t., don't even trip about your pants dawg. here's a pair on us, fool.
