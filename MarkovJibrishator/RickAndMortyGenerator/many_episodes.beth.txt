 morty, are you getting sick? (morty lifts his head, clearly exhausted,
 dad?
 jerry!
 oh, dad…
 scalpel.
 jerry?
 jerry, please tell me you're here for an incredibly urgent reason.
 okay, i only ask, jerry, because, as you know, my job involves performing heart surgery.
 hey, tom! we know when we're losing him. (at the top of her lungs) we can hear the beeps!
 i am not putting my father in a home! he just came back into my life, and you want to grab him and stuff him under a mattress like last month's victoria's secret?
 it's fine, davin.
 look, i appreciate the stress you're under, but morty was having trouble in school way before my dad moved in, and the only influence i can see rick having is that, for the first time in his life, morty has a friend.
 uh, yeah, maybe i am. i'm my father's daughter. i'm smart. why do you think i'm a heart surgeon?
 what? why didn't you notify us?
 summer?
 we're moving you to a nursing home.
 oh, don't high-road us, dad. you know fully well that morty is the last child that needs to be missing classes.
 what the hell?
 jerry, i don't want whatever's happening here to stop.
 you know what? okay.
 jerry?
 oh, jerry. you mean because it had dogs in it.
 alive? for your parents?
 hey man!
 aw, dad… that is so sweet.
 holy crap, joyce. that’s amazing.
 hey dad, where’s morty?
 whatever it is, it’s beautiful leonard. *glares at jerry* and we support you.
 jerry, come on. this is what you wanted.
 what? jerry, let that stuff go, okay? i’m sorry i was a bitch earlier. let’s just be here.
 jerry doesn’t know what he’s missing.
 i dunno, jacob. jerry got an invitation to be alive today, and he rejected it. i don’t know if our marriage will—
 oh god.
 jerry!
 *robotic* i’m going to work. morty, good morning. dad, good morning. i am going to work. goodbye. (beth drives away.)
 (at simulation smith house) *answers phone* hello.
 who just sold the apples campaign?
 yes.
 okay.
 yes.
